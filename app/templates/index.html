<p>
We are gathering data to improve the speech recognition in 
<a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/letsgo/">Let's Go</a>, an automated bus route information
system. We need you to listen to 26 clips of speech from actual callers
and write out what you think they said
{%if hard%}
and any other sounds they make, or background noises that can be heard
{%endif%}. 
Some of the clips may be incomplete.
</p>
<p>
{%if hard %}
Please mark incomplete words or stuttering with a dash at the start or end
of the word, e.g. "I’m go- I’m going to South Side Works." Also, indicate
background noises in brackets, e.g. "[cars passing by] Forbes and Craig to
Sixth and Smithfield."
{%else%}
Please ignore any incomplete words, hesitations like “um," or stuttering.
Only write down complete words, and ignore any background noises or throat
clearing, etc.
{%endif%}
</p>
<p>
Capitalization and punctuation don't matter as long as the words are
clearly labelled. Please write place names as fully as possible, e.g.
"Fifth Avenue" rather than "5th Ave." If you are unsure of a word, please
make your best guess or use three questions marks (???).
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>
Example 1 contains speech only, with very little background noise:<br/>
Blah blah blahdey blah.
</p>
<p>
Example 2 has some background noises:<br/>
{%-if hard -%}[NOISES]{%endif%}Blah blah blahdey blah.
</p>
<p>
Example 3 includes noises from the speaker themselves: <br/>
Blah blah blahdey blah.{%-if hard -%}[NOISES]{%endif%}
</p>
<p>
Example 4 has some hesitation: <br/>
{%if hard %}
Um I’m going to um Fifth Avenue and Neg- Negley Avenue.
{% else %}
I'm going to Fifth Avenue and Negley Avenue.
{% endif %}
