We are gathering data to improve the speech recognition in 
<a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/letsgo/">Let's Go</a>, an automated bus
route information system. We need you to listen to 26 clips of speech from
actual callers and write out what they said{%if hard%}, any sounds they made,
and any background noises that can be heard{%endif%}. We recommend listening
with headphones. Note that some of the clips may be incomplete.
</p>

<p>
{%if hard %}
Please mark incomplete words or stuttering with a dash at the start or end of
the word, e.g. "I'm go- I'm going to South Side Works." Indicate background
noises in brackets with a description of the sound, e.g. "[cars passing by]
Forbes and Craig to Sixth and Smithfield". Following are the tags for background
noises that you may use:<br/>
1. [car horn]<br/>
2. [cough]<br/>
3. [cry]<br/>
4. [noise] <br/>
{%else%}
Only write down complete words; please ignore any incomplete words, hesitations
such as  â€œum", or stuttering. Also ignore any background noises, such as passing
cars or throat clearing.
{%endif%}
</p>

<p>
Capitalization and punctuation don't matter as long as the words are clearly
labeled. Please write place names as fully as possible, e.g.  "Fifth Avenue"
rather than "5th Ave". Please write bus numbers as one word, e.g. "61D".  If you
are unsure of a word, please make your best guess or use three questions marks
, e.g. "???".
